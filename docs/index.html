<h1>FDA Inspection Sites and CDC Health Statistics</h1>
<p>
	Hundreds of cGMP facilities exists to manufacture regenerative therapies
	needed to treat chronic disease, including arthritis. Is that manufacturing capacity
	sufficient and is it located in proximity to patient populations?
	Let's build a map of FDA inspected facilities producing biological products
	overlaid on a heatmap of a leading degenerative disease, arthritis, to better understand.

	<br><br>

	The US FDA enforces Current Good Manufacturing (cGMP) regulations by
	inspecting facilites worldwide that make active ingredients and finished products.
	<a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/pharmaceutical-quality-resources/facts-about-current-good-manufacturing-practices-cgmps"
	target="_blank" rel="noopener">[1] </a>

	Inspection records are publicly available through the FDA Compliance Dashboard.
	<a href="https://datadashboard.fda.gov/ora/cd/inspections.htm"
	target="_blank" rel="noopener">[2] </a>

	 This map shows 516 facilities worldwide that passed FDA inspection in the past 5 years
	 that produce a biological product related to human tissue or gene vectors.

	 <br>
	 The FDA inspection manufacturing facilities are mapped over a heatmap of
	 CDC statistics on arthritis.

	 MSC could be uniquely equipped to treat arthritis.
	 Allogeneic MSC offer great promise in the treatment of arthritis due to their
	 anti-inflammatory proerties.
	 <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25481552/"
 	 target="_blank" rel="noopener">[3] </a>

	 Even expensive therapies are viable.
	 The CDC estimates arthritis costs the US $303.5 billion each year through
	 medical expenses and lost wages.
	 <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/publications/factsheets/arthritis.htm"
   target="_blank" rel="noopener">[4] </a>

	 MSC therapies for arthritis have been approved for a decade abroad.
	 Stem cell therapeutic developer, Medi-Post commercialized
	 an allogenic MSC therapy to treat osteoarthritis, CartiStem,
	 which has been approved for use in Korea since 2012.
	 <a href="https://www.medi-post.com/cartistem/"
   target="_blank" rel="noopener">[5] </a>

	 CDC published statistic on disease, including arthritis, by county.
	 The map shows the crude prevalence of arthritis in each county as a percentage
	 of population. Red counties have a higher prevalence of arthritis than
	 white counties. The highest prevalence is 42% of the county population.

<h1>The making of the map.</h1>
<p>
	<b>Objective:</b> <br> Overlay the location of US-FDA inspected facilities
	with a heatmap of arthritis in the United States.
	<br> <br> <b>Tasks:</b>
	<ol>
	<li> Initialize a git repo for the source data,
		code to process the data (python), and
		code to create the website (html, css, and js).
		<a href="https://github.com/jesnyder/mapGMP"_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/jesnyder/mapGMP</a>
	<li> Download CDC Statistics: Download the Arthritis-Crude Prevalence
		statistics for the most recent year (2015).
		<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/data_statistics/state-data-current.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/data_statistics/state-data-current.htm</a>
	<li> Download a geoJSON file describing the shape of each US county
	<li> Coregister the downloaded CDC Statistics with geographic description of the
		US county using the countyFID as a common idenifier.
	<li> Download the US FDA inspection records. Filter the results online before downloading.
		Limit the "Project Area" to "Human Cellular, Tissue, and Gene Therapy", the "Product Type" to "Biologics", the Fiscal Year to
		all years since and including 2015, and the facility passed inspection, meaning
		the "Classification" is only "No Action Indicated (NAI)". The Data Dashboard returned more than 3000 results fitting the aforementioned criteria.
		<a href="https://datadashboard.fda.gov/ora/cd/inspections.htm"_blank" rel="noopener">https://datadashboard.fda.gov/ora/cd/inspections.htm</a>
	<li> Scrub the FDA facility list to remove locations working on
		fertility, organ/tissue donation, blood donation, cornea implants,
		medical offices, medical supply companies, dental implant manufacturers,
		and most spine-focused projects.
		These restriction filtered the list from more than 3000 records to 500.
		<li> Prepare the FDA facility list to be mapped as a series of
			annotated points. To do this, convert the FDA inspection site list, which is
			a .csv converted to a pandas dataframe, to geoJSON and save as a .js file
			that sets the geoJSON equal to a unique variable.
		<li> Build the interactive website. Leverage Leaflet tutorials to write the html, css, and js to build the website
			using the county data coregistered with cdc statistics and the
			fda facility list as a series of points.
		<li> Explore!
